  # *** CRITICAL CONFIGURATION REQUIRED ***
  # The default_inventory_id is ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED for ANY AWX operations to work.
  # Without this, all AWX functionality (creating hosts, running jobs) will fail.
  # 
  # You MUST set this to a valid inventory ID from your AWX instance.
  # To find your inventory ID:
  # 1. Log in to AWX/Ansible Tower web interface
  # 2. Go to Inventories
  # 3. Select your inventory
  # 4. The ID is in the URL: /inventories/inventory/{id}/
  #    Example: if your URL is https://awx.example.com/#/inventories/inventory/3/
  #             then your inventory ID is 3
  #
  # NOTE: The AWX API requires this value - it CANNOT be 0 or empty!
  default_inventory_id: 2  # CHANGE THIS to your actual AWX inventory ID
  
  host_id_map:
    # Add any static host mappings here if needed
    # Format is "hostname": "awx_host_id"
