<h2 align="center">monokit</h2>
<b>monokit</b> is a collection of tools that were previously written in Bash in the <a href="https://github.com/monobilisim/mono.sh">mono.sh</a> repository. These tools are written in Go and provide a more efficient and faster alternative to the Bash scripts. The tools are cross-platform.

## Usage

1. Configure by editing the config files in `/etc/mono/`. You can default values in the `config` folder. Please keep in mind that to use any of the tools, you need to also configure `/etc/mono/global.yaml` file.

2. Run the desired tool using the following command as root:

```
monokit NAME
```

Replace NAME with the name of the tool you want to run (e.g. `osHealth`).

A log file will be put on `/var/log/monokit.log` if you want to check the errors. They will also be printed to stdout.

If you use Monokit on a place where there is no proper color support, you can disable the color output by setting the `MONOKIT_NOCOLOR`Â  environment variable to `true` or `1`.

## Kubernetes Deployment

Some components of monokit, like `k8sHealth`, can be deployed directly in Kubernetes. We've provided Kubernetes manifests and instructions to help you deploy these components in your cluster.

### k8sHealth in Kubernetes

To deploy k8sHealth in a Kubernetes cluster:

1. Go to the `k8sHealth/kubernetes/` directory
2. Update the `configmap.yaml` with your specific configurations
3. Run `./deploy.sh` to deploy all resources

The deployment includes:
- RBAC resources for appropriate permissions
- ConfigMap for configuration
- Deployment or CronJob (configurable) for running k8sHealth

For more details, see the [k8sHealth Kubernetes README](k8sHealth/kubernetes/README.md).

### Docker Images

Docker images for monokit are automatically built and published to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) through GitHub Actions. These images are built for multiple architectures (amd64 and arm64), so they'll work on both Intel/AMD and ARM-based systems including Raspberry Pi.

You can use these images in your Kubernetes deployments:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/monobilisim/monokit:latest  # Latest stable release
# OR
image: ghcr.io/monobilisim/monokit:1.2.3   # Specific version
```

---

## Building

To build monokit:

```
make
```

You can also build the documentation by running:

```
make docs
```

To build a binary with the API server:

```
make with-api
```

To see other options run:

```
make help
```

The resulting binaries will be in the `bin` folder.
