// This file previously implemented RAM usage monitoring functionality.
// The RamUsage() function, which checked RAM usage and generated alerts,
// has been integrated into the collectMemoryInfo() function in main.go
// as of version 2.3.1 (or the relevant version of this refactor).
//
// Package osHealth still handles RAM monitoring as part of its core data collection.
package osHealth

// No functions remain in this file.
